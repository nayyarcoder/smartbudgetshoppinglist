# smartbudgetshoppinglist
An Android app for managing a prioritized shopping list with three categories (need to have, good to have, nice to have). Track expected prices, mark items as purchased, and automatically reorganize items based on your monthly budget. Items can be manually reordered within categories, and all data is stored securely and locally on your device.
